**Design high-availability and cost-effective applications for the cloud**

## What is this book about?
Cloud computing has proven to be the most revolutionary IT development since virtualization. Cloud native architectures give you the benefit of more flexibility over legacy systems. To harness this, businesses need to refresh their development models and architectures when they find they donâ€™t port to the cloud. Cloud Native Architectures demonstrates three essential components of deploying modern cloud native architectures: organizational transformation, deployment modernization, and cloud native architecture patterns.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn the difference between cloud native and traditional architecture 
* Explore the aspects of migration, when and why to use it 
* Identify the elements to consider when selecting a technology for your architecture 
* Automate security controls and configuration management 
* Use infrastructure as code and CICD pipelines to run environments in a sustainable manner
